# Bug Report: Account Settings

**Page:** Account Settings (`/dashboard/account/settings`)  
**Date:** 2026-04-07  
**Test Status:** PASS ✅

No bugs found. Page loads correctly with:
- "Settings" heading (blurred behind connect gate)
- "Connect Wallet" modal overlay (expected — requires authentication)
- Form fields visible in background (blurred): display name, email fields, toggles
- "Connect Wallet" button in modal

The connect wallet gate is correct behavior.
