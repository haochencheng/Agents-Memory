# Bug Report: Services (Dashboard)

**Page:** My Services - Dashboard (`/dashboard/services`)  
**Date:** 2026-04-07  
**Test Status:** PASS ✅

No bugs found. Page loads correctly with:
- "My Services" heading and description
- "Back to Dashboard" button
- "+ New Service" (green CTA)
- "Wallet not connected. Connect and sign in to manage your API services and service definitions." message
- Info banner: "Active services are runtime-live. Switch a service to Inactive before editing its contract or routing fields."

**Note:** The provider-role version of services is at `/provider/services` (API Services) and has richer functionality (search, status filter, pagination). `/dashboard/services` is the owner-context entry point.
